> The history of Greece encompasses the history of the territory of the modern nation-state of Greece 
> as well as that of the Greek people and the areas they inhabited and ruled historically. 
> The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages 
> and as a result, the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes.
