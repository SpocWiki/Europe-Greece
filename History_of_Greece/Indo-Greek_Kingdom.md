## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Indo-Greek Kingdom, also known as the Yavana Kingdom, 
> was a Hellenistic-era Greek kingdom 
> covering various parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India. 
>
> The term "Indo-Greek Kingdom" loosely describes a number of various Hellenistic states, 
> ruling from regional capitals like Taxila, Sagala, Pushkalavati, and Bagram. 
> Other centers are only hinted at; e.g. Ptolemy's Geographia 
> and the nomenclature of later kings suggest 
> that a certain Theophilus in the south of the Indo-Greek sphere of influence 
> may also have had a royal seat there at one time. 
>
> The kingdom was founded when the Graeco-Bactrian king Demetrius I of Bactria 
> invaded India from Bactria in about 200 BC. 
> The Greeks to the east of the Seleucid Empire were eventually divided to 
> - the Graeco-Bactrian Kingdom and 
> - the Indo-Greek Kingdoms in the North Western Indian Subcontinent.
>
> During the two centuries of their rule, 
> the Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, 
> as seen on their coins, and blended Greek and Indian ideas, 
> as seen in the archaeological remains. 
> 
> The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, 
> particularly through the influence of Greco-Buddhist art. 
> 
> The ethnicity of the Indo-Greek may also have been hybrid to some degree. 
> Euthydemus I was, according to Polybius, a Magnesian Greek. 
> His son, Demetrius I, founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom, 
> was therefore of Greek ethnicity at least by his father. 
> 
> A marriage treaty was arranged for the same Demetrius 
> with a daughter of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III. 
> The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is sometimes less clear. 
> For example, Artemidoros (80 BC) was supposed to have been of Indo-Scythian descent, 
> although he is now seen as a regular Indo-Greek king. 
>
> Menander I, being the most well known amongst the Indo-Greek kings, 
> is often referred to simply as "Menander," 
> despite the fact that there was indeed another Indo-Greek King known as Menander II. 
> Menander I's capital was at Sakala in the Punjab (present-day Sialkot). 
> Following the death of Menander, most of his empire splintered 
> and Indo-Greek influence was considerably reduced. 
> 
> Many new kingdoms and republics east of the Ravi River 
> began to mint new coinage depicting military victories. 
> The most prominent entities to form were the Yaudheya Republic,  Arjunayanas, and the Audumbaras. 
> The Yaudheyas and Arjunayanas both are said to have won "victory by the sword". 
> The Datta dynasty and Mitra dynasty soon followed in Mathura.
>
> The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared as a political entity around 10 AD 
> following the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, 
> although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer 
> under the subsequent rule of the Indo-Parthians, the Kushans, and the Indo-Scythians, 
> whose Western Satraps state lingered on encompassing local Greeks, up to 415 CE.
