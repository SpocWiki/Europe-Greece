> Line 3 of the Athens Metro is a rapid transit line that runs 
> from Dimotiko Theatro in the west to Doukissis Plakentias or Athens Airport in the east, via Syntagma. 
> 
> Most Line 3 trains start or terminate at Doukissis Plakentias: 
> a through service to the Airport leaves once every 36 minutes, 
> and shares most of the extended route with the Athens Suburban Railway. 
> It runs for 47.3 kilometres (29.4 mi), making it the system's longest line.
>
> Line 3 provides a direct albeit infrequent service 
> between the Port of Piraeus with the Athens International Airport, 
> a journey that takes up to 59 minutes. 
> 
> The line between Dimotiko Theatro and Doukissis Plakentias is underground, 
> and the shared section with the Athens Suburban Railway 
> towards the Airport is a surface-level median of the A6 and A64 motorways.
>
> It first opened, between Ethniki Amyna and Syntagma, on 28 January 2000, with Line 2. 
> In 2012, construction works commenced for the latest underground extension of Line 3 
> to Dimotiko Theatro via Piraeus which was completed on 10 October 2022.
