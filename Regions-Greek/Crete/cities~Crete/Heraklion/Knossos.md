> **Knossos** (Ancient Greek: Κνωσσός, romanized: Knōssós, [knɔː.sós]; Linear B: 𐀒𐀜𐀰 Ko-no-so) 
> is a Bronze Age archaeological site in Crete. 
> 
> The site was a major centre of the Minoan civilization 
> and is known for its association with the Greek myth of Theseus and the minotaur. 
> It is located on the outskirts of Heraklion, and remains a popular tourist destination. 
> Knossos is considered by many to be the oldest city in Europe.
>
> Knossos is dominated by the monumental Palace of Minos. Like other Minoan palaces, this complex of buildings served as a combination religious and administrative centre rather than a royal residence. The earliest parts of the palace were built around 1900 BC in an area that had been used for ritual feasting since the Neolithic. The palace was continually renovated and expanded over the next five centuries until its final destruction around 1350 BC.
>
> The site was first excavated by Minos Kalokairinos in 1877. In 1900, Sir Arthur Evans undertook more extensive excavations which unearthed most of the palace as well as many now-famous artifacts including the Bull-Leaping Fresco, the snake goddess figurines, and numerous Linear B tablets. While Evans is often credited for discovering the Minoan Civilization, his work is controversial in particular for his inaccurate and irreversible reconstructions of architectural remains at the site.
