> Mount Parnassus (Greek: Παρνασσός, Parnassós) is a mountain range of Central Greece 
> that is, and historically has been, especially valuable to the Greek nation 
> and the earlier Greek city-states for many reasons. 
> 
> In peace, it offers scenic views of the countryside 
> and is a major international recreational site with views of mountain landscapes. 
> 
> Economically, its rolling foothills and valleys host extensive groves of olive, 
> a cash crop marketed world-wide since prehistory. 
> The mountain is also the location of historical, archaeological, and other cultural sites, 
> such as Delphi perched on the southern slopes of the mountain in a rift valley north of the Gulf of Corinth.
>
> Parnassus has an abundance of trails for hiking in the three warm seasons. 
> In the winter, the entire range is open to skiing, especially from the resorts of Arachova. 
> Its melting snows are a source of municipal water for the surrounding communities. 
> The mountain is composed of limestone, but also contains bauxite aluminum ore, 
> which is mined and processed. 
> 
> In war, Parnassus has been a center of resistance if need be, providing cover and refuge to partisans.
>
> Parnassus is mentioned in early Ancient Greek literature. 
> Many of its ancient communities are cited in Homer's Iliad. 
> 
> From a linguistic point of view, it was home to states of the Dorians, 
> such as the Phokians, who spoke a Doric dialect, Phokian. 
> 
> According to Greek mythology, 
> this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; 
> it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.
>
> However, there is a significant gap in the proto-history of the name, Parnassos. 
> Mycenaean settlements were abundant to the south and east. 
> 
> They had good views of Parnassus, and climbed some part of it frequently, 
> and yet the name remains unattested in what is known of their language, 
> Mycenaean Greek, which is written in Linear B script.
