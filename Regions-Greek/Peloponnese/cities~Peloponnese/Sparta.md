> It lies at the site of ancient Sparta within the Evrotas Valley.

> for a total population (as of 2021) of 32,786, of whom 17,773 lived in the city.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Sparta** was a prominent city-state in Laconia in ancient Greece. 
> In antiquity, the state was known as Lacedaemon (Λακεδαίμων, Lakedaímōn), 
> while "Sparta" referred to its capital, a group of villages in the valley of the Evrotas River 
> in Laconia, in southeastern Peloponnese. 
> 
> Around 650 BC, it rose to become one of the major military powers in Greece, 
> a status it retained until 371 BC.
>
> Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military 
> during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens. 
> 
> Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), 
> from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami. 
> 
> Thebes' victory over Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Spartan hegemony 
> and freed Messenia from Spartan rule; the loss of the slave labor this region provided 
> sent the city into terminal decline as a military power, though it retained its independence 
> until its forcible integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC. 
> 
> The city recovered some autonomy after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC 
> and became a tourist destination during the Roman era, restoring some measure of prosperity. 
> 
> However, Sparta was sacked in 396 AD by the Visigothic king Alaric, 
> and underwent a long period of decline into the medieval period, 
> when much of its population relocated to Mystras. 
> Modern Sparta is a provincial town and the seat of the Laconia regional administration.
>
> Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, 
> which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical lawgiver Lycurgus. 
> 
> Spartan society was exceptionally militarized, 
> focusing the entire attention of the Spartiate class on military training and physical development 
> to the point of legally barring them from productive economic activity. 
> 
> The inhabitants of Sparta were rigidly stratified into Spartiates (citizens with full rights), 
> mothakes and perioikoi (free non-citizens), and helots (state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals), 
> with helots making up the vast majority of the population; 
> social mobility was nearly nonexistent. 
> 
> Spartiate men underwent the harsh agoge training regimen, 
> and Spartan phalanx units were widely considered to be among the best in battle, 
> though this was as much a matter of propaganda as battlefield prowess. 
> 
> Free Spartiate women enjoyed somewhat greater legal rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity, 
> though helots suffered exceptionally harsh treatment at the hands of the Spartiates 
> (particularly the Crypteia), causing repeated revolts. 
> 
> Sparta was a subject of fascination in its own day, 
> as well as in later Western culture following the revival of classical learning. 
> 
> The admiration of Sparta is known as Laconophilia.
